Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the values only.



def Dict():
    d2=dict()
    for i in range(1,21):
        d2[i]=i**2
    print (d2)    
Dict()
