Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

print([i for i in range(2000,3200)if not(i%7) and i%5])

nl=[]
for x in range(2000, 3200):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5!=0):
        nl.append(str(x))
print (','.join(nl))
