Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
n=int(input("Input a number to compute the factiorial : "))
print(factorial(n))
